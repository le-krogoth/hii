.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a FIFO and file system based IRC client.
It is heavily inspired by
.Xr ii 1
but offers more features, e.g. built-in TLS support.
.Pp
Just as
.Xr ii 1
.Nm
creates a directory tree for the server containing subdirectory for
every channel joined and private conversation started on that server.
The following files are created in each directory:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-nosplitX" -offset indent -compact
.It Pa in
A
.Xr fifo 7
which can be used to write messages to the IRC server.
If the messages is prefixed with a backslash it is transmitted as a raw
IRC message, otherwise a
.Em PRIVMSG
with the given text is created and send to the channel/user associated
with the current subdirectory.
This file is removed as soon as
.Nm
terminates.
.It Pa out
A regular file containing messages received from the IRC server in a
human readable format.
The file only contains IRC messages associated with the channel/user
represented by the subdirectory.
This file is not removed on program termination.
.El
.Pp
On startup
.Nm
attempts to connect to the given
.Ar server .
If a connection was established successful it automatically joins the
given IRC
.Ar channels
(if any). A subdirectory containing the files described above is created
for each channel.
Alternatively, subdirectory are also created when the user joins a
channel manually by writing an IRC join message to the
.Pa in
.Xr fifo 7 .
.Pp
.Nm
makes no attempt to reestablish the connection, it simply terminates
when the connection to the IRC server is lost.
Automatic reconnection can be achieved by starting
.Nm
through a service supervisor such as
.Xr runsv 8 .
