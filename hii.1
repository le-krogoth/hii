.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a FIFO and file system based IRC client.
It is heavily inspired by
.Xr ii 1
but offers more features, e.g. built-in TLS support.
.Pp
Just as
.Xr ii 1
.Nm
creates a directory tree for the server containing subdirectories for
every conversation started on that server.
This includes public IRC channels and private conversations with other users.
The following files are created in each directory:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-nosplitX" -offset indent -compact
.It Pa in
A FIFO which can be used to write messages to the IRC server.
If the messages is prefixed with a backslash it is transmitted as a raw
IRC message, otherwise a
.Em PRIVMSG
with the given text is created and send to the channel/user associated
with the current subdirectory.
This file is removed as soon as
.Nm
terminates.
.It Pa out
A regular file containing messages received from the IRC server in a
human readable format.
The file only contains IRC messages associated with the channel/user
represented by the subdirectory.
This file is not removed on program termination.
.El
.Pp
On startup
.Nm
attempts to connect to the given
.Ar server .
If a connection was established successful it automatically joins the
given IRC
.Ar channels
(if any). A subdirectory containing the files described above is created
for each channel.
Alternatively, subdirectory are also created when the user joins a
channel manually by writing an IRC join message to the
.Pa in
FIFO.
Subdirectories for private conversations with other users are created as
soon as a
.Em PRIVMSG
is send or received directly from a user.
.Pp
.Nm
makes no attempt to reestablish the connection, it simply terminates
when the connection to the IRC server is lost.
Automatic reconnection can be achieved by starting
.Nm
through a service supervisor such as
.Xr runsv 8 .
